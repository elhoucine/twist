                            I began developing this blog application as part of a tutorial then it became my playground to explore and understand React/NextJs,
                            along with various other tools. Initially, the plan was to populate it with placeholder lorem ipsum content for testing purposes.
                            However, I decided to add a twist: rather than filling it with mundane text,
                            I&apos;m using this platform as a dual opportunity to enhance my writing skills as well.
                            <br></br>
                            That said PLEASE consider both the app and its content (as helpful as it could be) not stable and may change or vanish any time.
